# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company.

Key Takeaways from the Graphs:

Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts are a significant driver of churn.
Tenure: Shorter tenure is associated with higher churn.
Internet Service: Customers with fiber optic internet service are more likely to churn.
Total Charges and Monthly Charges: These numerical features are correlated and may influence churn.
Gender: Gender does not seem to be a large factor in churn.
Data Imbalance: The dataset is imbalanced, with more non-churned customers.
